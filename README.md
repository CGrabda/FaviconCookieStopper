## Motivation

Tracking companies can use favicons as a way to uniquely identify a user! [SuperCookie.me](https://supercookie.me/workwise) is a website that has a demonstration of this concept and an explanation of how it works. [Here](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~polakis/papers/solomos-ndss21.pdf) is a recent acedemic paper on the matter.

As a cybersecurity major, I don't like tracking!

## Features

- Deletes favicons except for bookmarked url's
- Executes each run, I recommend using Task Scheduler automate to run on login
- Currently only implementing MSedge, more browsers will come
- Have not added a startup file to automatically alter filepath, will have to change user's name manually

## How to Use

1. Download this repository
2. Using whatever means you'd like, run the python script
